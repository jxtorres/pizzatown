Welcome to the amazing world of Pizza Town. The world's first pizza rat open world video game. 
Get ready to fight your way through crowded subways, as you race to collect all the pizza 
ingredients you can get your hands on. But watch out for urgent meeting notification and other
dangers that lie in the city... If you're ever in trouble just hit up old uncle Xeno. He's 
always got an ear and a slice!














## Scratch Work
------------------------------------


Classes

A room,
A field
A pizza topping
an area
a character
the hero
dialogue


Groups of library functions... 

Types....


Functioanl and core classes. Using funcation class work...


Level 1 NY 57th street
xenos pizza
Run through the cars to get to the office before the meeting...
defeat the stree elmos.


mayb ecreator factor functions for making areas or actions. then you just call apply functions that take the structs output by 
the area or action... just dumb types.... and you feed them to the process world action function which will steal a frame and perform the change... but the time moves
sepearetely all actions can just be async...
all actions processed asap.. and frames keep chugging. only the hero movement should be part of game loop, 


so there is 


There should be a game asset library similar to unrealls

Automotive.Carpet
Automatoic.silver..

createDialogue() : Dialogue

playDialogue(): ACtion

createArea() : Area
createCharacter(deets, game): Character  //each charcacter will have an async light thread that will dump
                                            //characterActions onto the game loop but then move on...

createCharacterAction(deets): CharacterACtion                                           

spawnCharacter(Character) : Action

loadArea(Area) : Action

processWorldACtion(action) : void


game class{
    popAnACtionIfTimeAllows()
    popAnAction()
    loop()
}
